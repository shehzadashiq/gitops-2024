# Week 1

There were certain configurations which I would like to have carried out but ran out of time.

- Different environments as currently only Production is being used
- Plan and apply PR with this action [DevSecTop/TF-via-PR](https://github.com/DevSecTop/TF-via-PR)
- PR's to only be applied to staging with checks. Once PR's to staging were successful apply them to PR
- Ignore Non-Terraform changes
- Comment on a PR with useful plan information as suggested per the Rubric
